Challenges to building the backend
------
The initial challenges were finding good data.  The initial build went smooth to get it up and usable, however, finding clean data, or data that we could clean up, was more challenging.  Once that was done, we were able to start really working on the project.

As this is our first project where we truly had to integrate the frontend with the backend via API we had some growing pains.  

From figuring out how to connect the two sides using authentication, to how use data on the frontend, that was received from the backend, and then, once done with it, send it back to the database was challenging.  This, considering the scope of our project, was probably one of the most challenging and ongoing pieces to the backend.
